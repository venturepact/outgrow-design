				Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
			</h5>
			<p>
				Certain visitors to Outgrow’s websites choose to interact with Outgrow in ways that require Outgrow to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Outgrow gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Outgrow collects such information only as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Outgrow. Outgrow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
			</p>
			<h5>Aggregated Statistics</h5>
			<p>
				Outgrow may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Outgrow may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Outgrow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
			</p>
			<h5>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h5>
			<p>
				Outgrow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Outgrow’s behalf or to provide services available at Outgrow’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Outgrow’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Outgrow will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above.

If you are a registered user of a Outgrow website and have supplied your email address, Outgrow may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Outgrow and our products. We primarily use our various blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Outgrow takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
